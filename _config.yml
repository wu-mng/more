# x. SEO [TO DO]
# --------------

# see: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md for more infos.

# Actually the "x. Social Media" section and the "logo" option are very much 
# related to these options, but since we're gonna use them for other purposes 
# as well it might be worth to keep them separated. 
# This also make the configuration simpler for the user.

  #~ card: summary # The site's default card type

#~ facebook:
