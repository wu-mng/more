This post should display aÂ **header image**, if the theme supports it.

Non-square images can provide some unique styling issues.

This post tests a vertical header image.
{: .clear }

To display a featured image in the header, just add its url to the post's **Front Matter**: 

```yaml

```
you could even omit the relative url and just leave the file name, but it's better

You can also add the `alt` and `caption` tags:
