Putting special characters in the title should have no adverse effect on the layout or functionality.

Special characters in the post title have been known to cause issues with JavaScript and XML when not properly encoded and escaped.

Please be aware that if you put markdown and html formatted characters in the 
title field they will be properly interpreted and rendered, so pay attention to
potentially breaking text.
